At the core of our project, we are using an STM32-WL55JC1 microprocessor. Sensors are being programmed into the system via SPI or I2C. Current sensors in use include gaseous temperature, humidity, pressure and altitude. Expanding further, we have an interest in methane and carbon dioxide. </div></td><tr></table></div>';
